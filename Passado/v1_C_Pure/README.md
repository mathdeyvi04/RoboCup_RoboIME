# v1_C_Pure

* With the v0_C version, which has a user-controlled player,
the idea of the v1_C_Pure version is to build a clean version 
of the controller.


* Since it is clean, it will not be able to do anything yet. We 
will use it to fill it with automated control models.


* For more, see the [_readme.md_ in the v0_C](../v0_C/readme.md)
